📓 Devlog: Peek #1 – The Flash Before the Fall
📅 Date: 2025-06-20
🌀 Milestone: First fully animated raccoon attack with juice

🧠 Summary
The raccoon now attacks with proper cartoon menace.
It enters a full windup animation, flashes red for a split-second of warning, and then WHAM — a punch that knocks the coyote flat.

But the real star?

🐜 The fleas.
Even as Dust hits the ground, the fleas keep hopping. Unbothered. Unapologetic.
The trash never sleeps.

🎬 GIF Peek

"The red flash is not a warning — it’s a prophecy."

🛠️ What’s Happening Under the Hood:
Windup state added to Animator, triggered via isWindingUp == true

Flash effect triggered right before attack using a FlashColor() coroutine

Attack flows cleanly from windup → hit using a trigger

Raccoon attack now freezes the player and triggers their damage logic

Flea particles remain active after knockdown because they're tied to Dust, not his state (which… is honestly better this way)

🧪 Lessons Learned:
The Animator doesn’t work unless the states are actually connected (lol)

Adding a tiny flash before impact massively improves feel

Emergent animation moments (like the flea hopping) can make the scene

Code and animation are now harmonized like slapstick sorcery

🔮 What’s Next:
Add knockback or bounce when player is hit?

Animate raccoon retreating or taunting after attack

Let the player spritz mid-windup to interrupt?

Give fleas their own subroutine or lore page?? 😭
